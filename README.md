Description:
This repository contains Python implementations of three popular sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort. Sorting algorithms are essential in computer science and can be crucial for improving the efficiency of various applications.

Bubble Sort:
In Bubble Sort algorithm, in every iteration we compare the elements of arr[0] with arr[1], arr[1] with arr[2] and so on. If the first number is greater than the second number we interchange. There are n-1 iterations.

Insertion Sort:
First we assume that arr[0] is already sorted. Thus we have two parts- Sorted and unsorted part. In this algo, in every iterations, from unsorted part we take one elements one by one and insert it into the sorted part in its proper place. There are n-1 iterations.

Selection Sort:
In this algorithm, in every iteration we search the smallest element from arr[0],arr[1],...arr[n-1] respectively and interchange it with arr[0],arr[1],...arr[n-1] respectively. There are n-1 iterations.
